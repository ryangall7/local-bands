                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">“We&apos;re a band of locals” Justin Pisteoff shouted out to a packed in crowd at Grumpy&apos;s last night at the launch of his new initiative Local Band.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">Pisteof a local disgruntled Ketchum resident is at it again.  He launched his Stay Surly initiative in 2022 parodying Visit Sun Valley&apos;s Stay Sunny campaign.  Last year he published the Worst Of The Valley Awards and this year Ketchum&apos;s favorite curmudgeon is introducing Local Band aimed at recognizing Wood River Valley residents according to how long they have lived here.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">The Local Band is a “badge of honor” Pisteoff said as I caught up with him after the press conference at Grumpys. “The Local Band (of which there are eight different levels) demonstrates and recognizes the type of grit and determination it sometimes takes to live here”</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">“I&apos;m proud to be able to call this beautiful Valley my home for 32 years and as any one that&apos;s lived here a long time knows, it&apos;s not easy.</p>

                        <h2 className="h3 my-4">The Eras</h2>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">Gone are the ski-bum era days when you could take a year off after college, pick up a restaurant job, buy a seasons pass and live in Ketchum.  I managed to survive that period but many of my friends financially perished, losing their battle to a safer and more secure city existence.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">Then the 2008 era came along.  That crises almost wiped out many of us Ski Bum era survivors that had managed to scrape enough money together to buy an apartment of our own.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">By this time the Online Shopping era was in full swing causing tremendous hardships for local retail businesses and their employees.</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">Then along came the AirBnB era, soaring rents and waves of remote office workers, further squeezing what was left of the ski bum era not fortunate enough to be able to buy a place of their own </p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">And finally the COVID era.  Some of us thought this might offer a respite.  A chance to hit the pause button from the untenable affordable housing crises.  How wrong we were!</p>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">Anyone that has survived all this needs a medal or at the very least a Local Band, something that can be worn with pride as a symbol of an unwavering determination to live the magical dream that is to call Sun Valley home”.</p>

                        <h2 className="h3 my-4">Birds of a Feather</h2>
                        <p className="text-lg text-left text-gray-600 mb-2">“On a lighter note” Pisteoff said as he peered along the bar at Grumpy’s. See that fella over there, I’ve never seen him before but he looks like the kinda fella I’d get on with. Now if I were to look down at his wrist and I saw a gold/yellow or red Local Band, I’d know he was an  someone that was either born here or moved here during the 60’s or 70’s. If I saw that Local Band I’d definitely go over and say hi. These folks are true legends, they have great stories. Revere them and if you get a chance to talk to them, do! You’ll definitely learn something.</p>
